          <h6>
            Documents Documents that Establish Both Identity and Employment
            Authorization
          </h6>
          The documents on List A show both identity and employment
          authorization. Employees presenting an acceptable List A document
          should not be asked to present any other document. Some List A
          documents are in fact a combination of 2 or more documents. In these
          cases, the documents presented together count as one List A document.
          <h6>U.S. Passport or U.S. Passport Card</h6>
          <img src={Passport} alt="passport" id="passport" />
          <h6>
            Form I-551, Permanent Resident Card or Alien Registration Receipt
            Card
          </h6>
          <p>
            On May 1, 2017, USCIS began issuing redesigned cards that no longer
            display the individual’s signature. However, some cards issued after
            May 1, 2017, may still display the previous format. Both the
            previous and new cards will remain valid until the expiration date
            shown on the card. These cards are also known as “Green Cards.”
          </p>
          <h6>Permanent Resident Card:</h6>
          <img src={front} alt="greencardfront" id="greencardfront" />
          <img src={back} alt="greencardback" id="greencardback" />
          <p>
            The previous version of the cards was issued after April 30, 2010,
            and may or may not contain a signature. A signature is not required
            for the card to be valid for Form I-9, Employment Eligibility
            Verification.
          </p>
          <h6>Previous Permanent Resident Card with signature:</h6>

          <p>
            Additionally, a Permanent Resident Card with a USCIS-issued sticker
            extending its validity is a List A document and acceptable for Form
            I-9.
          </p>
          <img src={sticker} alt="sticker" />
          <h6>Form I-766, Employment Authorization Document Card</h6>
          USCIS began issuing the current card on May 1, 2017. However, some
          cards issued after May 1, 2017, may still display the previous format.
          Both the previous and new cards will remain valid until the expiration
          date shown on the card.

            Foreign passport with Form I-94 or Form I-94A with Arrival-Departure
            Record, and containing an endorsement to work
          </h6>
          <p>
            A foreign passport must be accompanied by a Form I-94/94A
            Arrival-Departure Record bearing the same name as the passport and
            containing an endorsement of the individual’s nonimmigrant status
            and authorization to work for a specific employer based on this
            status. This document may only be used if the period of endorsement
            has not yet expired and the proposed employment does not conflict
            with any restrictions or limitations listed on Form I-94 or I-94A,
            Arrival-Departure Record. Note: Some individuals who present this
            List A document, such as certain nonimmigrant students and exchange
            visitors, must present additional documentation in order to prove
            their work authorization in the U.S. In April 2013, Form I-94 was
            automated at airports and seaports. U.S. Customs and Border
            Protection no longer automatically provides travelers with a paper
            copy of Form I-94. Travelers may access Form I-94 information
            through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website or may
            request a paper Form I-94 during the inspection process.
